# Next.js example app

Use this Next.js example app as a tool to start building an app with XMTP. This basic messaging app has an intentionally unopinionated UI to help make it easier for you to build with.

The app is built using the [React XMTP client SDK](/packages/react-sdk/README.md), [React](https://react.dev/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/).

To keep up with the latest example app developments, see the [Issues tab](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-web/issues) in this repo.

To learn more about XMTP and get answers to frequently asked questions, see the [XMTP documentation](https://xmtp.org/docs).

## Limitations

This example app isn't a complete solution. For example, the list of conversations doesn't update when new messages arrive in existing conversations.

## Developing

1. In `packages/react-sdk`, run `yarn build` to build the React SDK.
2. In `examples/nextjs`, run `yarn dev` to start the development server.

## Useful commands

- `yarn build`: Builds the example app
- `yarn clean`: Removes `node_modules`, `dist`, and `.turbo` folders
- `yarn dev`: Launches the example app and watches for changes, which will trigger a rebuild
- `yarn format`: Runs prettier format and write changes
- `yarn format:check`: Runs prettier format check
- `yarn lint`: Runs ESLint
- `yarn typecheck`: Runs `tsc`
